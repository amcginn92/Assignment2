# Assignment2
This application could be used as a basis for a sign up form. It provides errors when values are not complete. Specifically if any of the text boxes aren't filled and the 
program hasn't been selected. It also has a silly message if you haven't done that last part. It will also withhold its most useful function, displaying a greeting message
if the user fails to do any of these tasks. If you need help with something you can reach out to me. Although, I don't believe you should have access to this if you aren't
a student, and would ask you to shield your eyes if you somehow have gotten here despite that fact. No one is going to maintain this, so good luck!
